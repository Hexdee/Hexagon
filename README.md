# Hexagon

This repository contains the code for the Hexagon, which enables secure drug authentication using blockchain technology. The repository consists of two main components: the frontend and the smart contract.

## Frontend

The frontend folder contains the code for the user interface of the Hexagon. It is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The frontend allows users to interact with the smart contract deployed on the blockchain, verify drug authenticity, track manufacturers, and view drug information.

To set up and run the frontend, follow the instructions provided in the [frontend folder README](./frontend/README.md).

## Smart Contract

The contract folder contains the Solidity smart contract code for the Hexagon. The smart contract is deployed on the Filecoin FVM Blockchain, providing a secure and decentralized infrastructure for drug authentication. It includes functionalities for manufacturer registration, product creation, item verification, and more.

To compile, deploy, and interact with the smart contract, refer to the instructions provided in the [contract folder README](./contract/README.md).
